Hi, I’m Pol Sarís, a 25-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast from Girona, Spain. I graduated in Computer Engineering and worked as a DevOps engineer for 2 years, where I gained strong experience in Linux systems, automation, and cloud technologies.

For the past 4 years, I’ve been dedicated to learning and practicing red teaming through CTFs, labs, and courses. I have recently started doing Bug Bounty Hunting. I recently obtained the HackTheBox CPTS certification and I’m currently preparing for OSCP.

I’m actively seeking opportunities as a junior penetration tester and I’m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals.

## How did I get into Red Team?
My story is the opposite of most hackers, who started hacking at a very young age, first with video games or their parents’ computer, and then evolving into real hacking.
I have been involved with computers since I was 5, but never for hacking, only to play video games. I have always been the tech guy in my house, but I had never done anything related to cybersecurity. I enrolled in Computer Engineering simply because I liked computers, nothing more.

I discovered hacking at the end of my 3rd year of Computer Engineering, with 1 year left before graduation. I had always been good at studying, with little effort, I usually passed with good grades in math and science. I didn’t care much before, but as you grow up and realize your studies are coming to an end and your career choices will shape the rest of your life, it was time to make a decision. I enjoyed Computer Engineering, I found it fascinating and I was enjoying the learning process, but I didn’t see myself as a programmer or a system administrator or any of the other typicall jobs everybody chooses.

Then one day, I saw in the news the arrest of a Spanish hacker, and I became curious. (I had always wondered how hacking really worked, but I had never looked into it.) I started researching and discovered that you could work as an ethical hacker, simulating real-world attacks to find security flaws and help companies improve their security. I began watching hacking videos, programming very simple malware I found on YouTube and testing it myself, getting into easy CTFs, and I loved it. Since that moment, I knew this was what I wanted to do for a living. I have been learning ethical hacking through self-study since 2021, combining it with work and university, and practicing every day I can.
